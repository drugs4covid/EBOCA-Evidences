  The EBOCA Evidences Ontology aims to describe provenance and metadata for
  evidences of associations among concepts. It reuses classes and properties
  from several ontologies:
  [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](http://semanticscience.org/ontology/sio.owl),
  [Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO)]( http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco.owl),
  [Friend Of A Friend (FOAF)](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/),
  [DCMI Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/),
  [Provenance, Authoring and Versioning (PAV)](https://pav-ontology.github.io/pav/),
  and the SPAR Ontologies
  [FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO)](https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html#) and
  [Document Components Ontology (DoCO)](https://sparontologies.github.io/doco/current/doco.html#).

  The associations between concepts are represented with the class ``sio:SIO_000897`` "association".
  This association can be annotated with its creator (``pav:createdBy``), that is a ``foaf:Agent``;
  and the software (``dc:Software``) it was created with (``pav:createdWith``). This association
  is linked to its correspondent ``Evidence`` with ``sio:SIO_000772`` "has evidence".

  The class ``Evidence`` is a subclass of ``obo:ECO_0000000`` "evidence". Two subclasses of "evidence"
  are highlighted, "computational inference" and "documented statement evidence". Evidences
  can be annotated optionally with a confidence score (``score``), date of creation (``pav:createdOn``)
  and update (``pav:lasUpdatedOn``), and version (``pav:version``). The provenance of the evidence
  can be indicated with ``pav:derivedFrom``.

  The use case for which this ontology is implemented consist in extracting evidences of
  associations between biomedical concepts from texts â€“ more exactly, from paragraphs.
  For that reason, the class ``doco:Paragraph`` is reused. To add more information to where
  the paragraphs come form and where can they be found, the class ``fabio:Expression`` is
  reused.
